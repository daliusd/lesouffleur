# Le Souffleur

Playwright has really good [codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) tool,
but you are stuck with Puppeteer. Then this library is what you need as it
allows to take code generated by Playwright's `codegen` and use it in Puppeteer
with minimal changes.

This is very early version that might be improved in the future. Here some ideas:

- [ ] Add tests

- [ ] Add custom jest matchers. `codegen` generates matchers like
      `toContainText` or `toBeVisible` that are not supported by this library yet

- [ ] Allow to specify test id attribute (in current implementation `data-hook`
      is used)

- [ ] Support more functions and cases. Only small subset of `codegen`
      generated code is supported now.

## Usage

```ts
import { LeSouffleur } from 'lesouffleur';

const driver = new LeSouffleur(page); // <-- Puppeteer page here
await driver.getByTestId('some-test-id').click();
await driver.getByRole('button', { name: 'Increment' }).click();
await driver.getByText('Approve').click();
```

## Misc

As both Playwright and Puppeteer is theatre related I simply chose name related
to theatre as well. See this Wikipedia article:
[Prompter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompter_(theatre)>)
